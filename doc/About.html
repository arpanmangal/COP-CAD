<b>CopCAD</b> is an out-of-the-box ready to use Engineering Drawing tool. The tool provides an easy-to-use and fast way to user to render any three dimensional object as wireframe and visualise its orthographic projections.
Also, given the three orthographic projections user can generate a wireframe to check the prototype of his/her model.
The tool also allows user to rotate the object with an easy to use slider, and view orthographic projections of the rotated object.<br>

The software expects the projection drawing or the three dimensional model to be input in the form of its vertex set and edge set.<br>

<small>Known issues : Extra coplanar edges when given only two projection views which are insufficient to determine a unique wireframe.</small><br>
